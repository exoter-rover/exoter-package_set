    <description brief="DSO: Direct Sparse Odometry">
    DSO is a novel direct and sparse formulation for Visual Odometry. It combines a
    fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with
    consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry -
    represented as inverse depth in a reference frame - and camera motion. This is
    achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct
    methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. DSO does not
    depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, thus it can naturally sample pixels
    from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or
    smooth intensity variations on mostly white walls. The proposed model integrates
    a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting,
    and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three
    different datasets comprising several hours of video. The experiments show that
    the presented approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art direct and
    indirect methods in a variety of real-world settings, both in terms of tracking
    accuracy and robustness.
